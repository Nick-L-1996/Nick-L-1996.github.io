    My name is Nicholas Lanotte and I am a graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying Robotics Engineering. I am
    from Shrewsbury Massachusetts where I graduated from Shrewsbury Highschool. I ran cross country and track in highschool which taught me how to
    live an active and healthy lifestyle. Running is still one of my favorite activities along with weight lifting.
    I finished my undergraduate degree at WPI in the spring of 2019, double majoring in Robotics Engineering and Electrical & Computer Engineering.
