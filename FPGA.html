<p>I took ECE3829 in the Fall of 2017, which taught designing digital circuits with an FPGA. The first lab
was a tutorial of the Vivado Software for programming the FPGA in Verilog. The other three lab projects had us implement
a variety of circuit designs and IO. </p>
<p>Lab 2 had my partner and I design a circuit to drive a VGA display and respond to a light sensor.
We designed the controller to drive the colors of the VGA display. The VGA display would display 1 of 4
patterns based on the input from 2 switches and vary the colors in some based on the light sensor
readings. The full details can be found in the report available for download</p>

<p>The third lab expanded on lab 2 by adding modules that would drive a Digital to Analog Converter
that would act as a function generator. This function generator could create a sinewave, a square wave,
a sawtooth wave, and a triangle wave. The VGA module was modified to allow for a block on screen
to be moved in a 2-dimensional grid. This lab also had us implement a test fixture in Vivado to simulate
the Waveform generator. Full details can be found in the report available for download</p>

<p>The fourth lab added an embedded microprocessor to the FPGA called the Microblaze microcontroller.
This microcontroller was programmed in C and meant to process strings input through a serial connection
from a computer and output a response to a serial window. Additional circuits were reused from previous
labs to drive a seven segment display for use with the microcontroller. The full details can be found in
    the report available for download</p>
