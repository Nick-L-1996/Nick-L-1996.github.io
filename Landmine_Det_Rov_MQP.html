<h1>Major Qualifying Project - Autonomous Landmine Detection Rover</h1>

<p style="padding-top: 10px">My Major Qualifying Project at WPI was to design an autonomous rover capable of detecting landmines with small amounts of metal
and physically mark them on the ground so that an octocopter drone could drop a sandbag on it to detonate. The goal between this rover
and the flying drone was to remove human and animal operators from the minefields, automating the entire process from searching to removal
    of landmines. This page will describe my contributions to the project.

<p>The report can be downloaded from WPI <a href="https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/mqp-all/6868/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p> The school interviewed us and created a video shown below.
