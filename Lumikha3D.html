<p1>Lumikha 3D is a start up started by a group of friends and I from WPI. We want to innovate in the 3D printing industry by further
    automating 3D printing for manufacturing and have a <b>patent pending</b>. We also provide robotics consulting services and low volume manufacturing.
We are locating in the Worcester CleanTech Incubator at the Printers building in Worcester Massachusetts. As we complete contract jobs and
advance the technology we are developing, this site will be updated with details that I can publicly discuss. Please look at our
    website: <a href="https://lumikha3d.com" target="_blank"> Lumikha3D.com</a></p1>
