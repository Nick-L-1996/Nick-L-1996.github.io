<h2>Robotics 1001 Project</h2>
   <p>I took the introductory robotics course from January to March in 2016. This course introduced me to
   programming and basic electrical circuit design. This course consisted of short labs and a final project robot.
   This robot needed to be designed to complete obstacles in a field with another robot competing at the same
   time. The main task was to score points by placing foam blocks through a hoop or in a short bin. The robot my
   team and I designed was a a four wheel drive remote controlled robot with 2 omni-wheels to allow it to rotate
   about the back wheels. It had a gripper with an extendable length and could rotate so that foam blocks could be
   picked up and dropped into the hoop. This robot also had to do a simple autonomous program at the start
   for extra points. Our robot was one of the only ones in the class to successfully execute an autonomous program.
   Unfortunately, many of the documents for this class have been lost but below is a short video clip of one of the
   rounds in the competition.</p>

<h2>Robotics 2001 Project</h2>
    <p>Robotics 2001 focused more on the mechanical side of robotics. For the final project, the robot need to
insert and remove plastic rods from holders using a 4-bar mechanism on a playing field. The robot also needed to communicate
with a base station. Some of these messages include a heartbeat, start, stop and status messages. This task
was to simulate a larger robot moving nuclear material between reactors and storage. We conducted force analysis on the
4-bar mechanism and motor torque calculations. The robot navigated the field by following black lines between storage
areas. My role on the team was mainly to program the robot but I also did a large amount of the design calculations.
        The final report can be downloaded below, which included the calculations and final code.</p>

<h2>Robotics 2002 Project</h2>
<p>
    Robotics 2002 was focused on sensing. For the final project we had to design a robot to autonomously
    navigate a maze and extinguish a lit candle. Our design was unique in that we used a Nintendo WiiMote to sense the
    flame. The WiiMote sent data such as size of the flame in its view, and x and y coordinates in the plane
    parallel to the front of it. The WiiMote was mounted onto a rotating platform with a large fan that would scan as the robot traversed
    the maze. Once the flame was found, the rotating platform would keep the fan aimed at the candle until the Robot became
    close enough to put it out. The robot used ultrasonic sensors to keep itself following the wall and could detect if
    it were about to move off of a cliff. More details can be found in the video. The lab report can also be found below.</p>
