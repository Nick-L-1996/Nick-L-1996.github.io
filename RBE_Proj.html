<h1>Robotics Projects</h1>
<p>This page details all of my Robotics Projects from my course sequence to my Senior Robotics Project.</p>
<h2>Robotics 1001 Project</h2>
   <p>I took the introductory robotics course from January to March in 2016. This course introduced me to
   programming and basic electrical circuit design. This course consisted of short labs and a final project robot.
   This robot needed to be designed to complete obstacles in a field with another robot competing at the same
   time. The main task was to score points by placing foam blocks through a hoop or in a short bin. The robot my
   team and I designed was a a four wheel drive remote controlled robot with 2 omni-wheels to allow it to rotate
   about the back wheels. It had a gripper with an extendable length and could rotate so that foam blocks could be
   picked up and dropped into the hoop. This robot also had to do a simple autonomous program at the start
   for extra points. Our robot was one of the only ones in the class to successfully execute an autonomous program.
   Unfortunately, many of the documents for this class have been lost but below is a short video clip of one of the
   rounds in the competition.</p>
