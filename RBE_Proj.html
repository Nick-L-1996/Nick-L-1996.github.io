<h2>Robotics 1001 Project</h2>

   <p>I took the introductory robotics course from January to March in 2016. This course introduced me to
   programming and basic electrical circuit design. This course consisted of short labs and a final project robot.
   This robot needed to be designed to complete obstacles in a field with another robot competing at the same
   time. The main task was to score points by placing foam blocks through a hoop or in a short bin. The robot my
   team and I designed was a a four wheel drive remote controlled robot with 2 omni-wheels to allow it to rotate
   about the back wheels. It had a gripper with an extendable length and could rotate so that foam blocks could be
   picked up and dropped into the hoop. This robot also had to do a simple autonomous program at the start
   for extra points. Our robot was one of the only ones in the class to successfully execute an autonomous program.
   Unfortunately, many of the documents for this class have been lost but below is a short video clip of one of the
   rounds in the competition.</p>

<h2>Robotics 2001 Project</h2>
    <p><img src="Files/Images/RBE2001Robot.png" width="600px" height="475" align="left"></p>
    <p>I took Robotics 2001 in the fall of 2016. This class focused on the mechanical side of robotics. For the final project, the robot need to
    insert and remove plastic rods from holders using a 4-bar mechanism on a playing field. The robot also needed to communicate
    with a base station. Some of these messages include a heartbeat, start, stop and status messages. This task
    was to simulate a larger robot moving nuclear material between reactors and storage. We conducted force analysis on the
    4-bar mechanism and motor torque calculations. The robot navigated the field by following black lines between storage
    areas. My role on the team was mainly to program the robot but I also did a large amount of the design calculations.
        The final report can be downloaded below, which included the calculations and final code.</p>

    <h2>Robotics 2002 Project</h2>

    I took Robotics 2002 in the spring of 2017. This class focused on sensing the environment. For the final project we had to design a robot to autonomously
    navigate a maze and extinguish a lit candle. Our design was unique in that we used a Nintendo WiiMote to sense the
    flame. The WiiMote sent data such as size of the flame in its view, and x and y coordinates in the plane
    parallel to the front of it. The WiiMote was mounted onto a rotating platform with a large fan that would scan as the robot traversed
    the maze. Once the flame was found, the rotating platform would keep the fan aimed at the candle until the Robot became
    close enough to put it out. The robot used ultrasonic sensors to keep itself following the wall and could detect if
    it were about to move off of a cliff. More details can be found in the video. The lab report can also be found below.</p>

<h2>Robotics 3001 Project</h2>
<p>I took Robotics 3001 in the spring of 2018. This class focused on controlling a 3-degree of freedom robotic manipulator. We used
MATLAB to complete a series of labs that built toward the final project. The final project combined computer vision with
the robotic manipulator to be able to pick up and sort 3 different colored objects we called "orbs". The robotic manipulator was
equipped with strain gauges to sense weight of objects but the construction of the arm proved to make the readings from these
sensors meaningless for the weights we were tasked at measuring. The code my team wrote would in theory be able to sort objects
of different weights if the sensors were reliable. I took the lead in this project, writing most of the robot code, mostly because
I enjoy coding so much. I added some bonus features for extra credit and created an in-depth video of the experience. This video
    can be found below and details the robot's functions. The final lab report for this class is also available for download.</p>

<h2>Robotics 3002 Project</h2>
    <p><img src="Files/Images/TurtleBot3Image.jpeg" align="right"> </p>
<p>I took Robotics 3002 later in the spring of 2018. This class focused on using the Robot Operating System (ROS) to program
the robot to map and explore a maze. There were 4 labs that built up the code needed to complete the final lab. The first lab was
a tutorial in ROS. The second had us program basic movement functions for the robot. The third lab had us implement an A-Star
search algorithm to explore a maze. The fourth lab had us implement obstacle expansion to the cost-map, path plan and avoid obstacles.
    Labs 3 and 4 were done in simulation so lab 5 was to get the real robot to map an area by identifying regions to explore and navigate
    to them by implementing past code. The robot was able to map a maze and follow a planned path, however there were errors in how ROS
    transformed reference frames so that the location of the robot was incorrect, affecting the robot's ability to accurately path plan.
