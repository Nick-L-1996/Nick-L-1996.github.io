<h2>Software Engineering Project</h2>
<p>In the late spring of 2018, I took software engineering. This class is very rigorous assigning me onto a team of 10 to develop
an application for Brigham & Women's Hospital. We applied agile methodologies over the course of 7 weeks, with the last 4 weeks
    being where the application was coded. My role on the team was to act as assistant lead engineer, although I took over
as lead engineer at certain times. I did much of the difficult functions of the User Interface, path-finding algorithms, the UI
for the path-finding robot along with much of the code that enabled its motion and integration with Google's text to speech API.
I was attributed as the largest contributor of code and thanked for all of the help I gave to my teammates. This class was set up
as a competition with 5 other teams with my team achieving a close second place.</p>
<p>This application needed to calculate and display paths around the hospital along with
display directions. A user could submit their phone number to have the list of directions sent to their phone.
    It was able to do this across multiple floors and highlight floors
    where the user needed to traverse. There was an admin login window that allowed access
    to submit service requests such as a request to clean a spill. Upon submission of a request, a person responsible
    for completing the task would be sent a text message, or if it was of high priority, contacted via a voice call.
    Administrators could view a heat map of the most traversed pathways in the hospital. A mobile application for Android
    containing just the pathfinding algorithms and visuals was developed as well. Unfortunately, I cannot show screenshots of the app because
the maps are sensitive information to the hospital</p>
<p>Arguably the most impressive feature of this application was the voice controlled path-finding robot we created as our bonus feature.
The robot ran the path-finding application but also had a unique set of UI to allow for it to path-find through a building.We demonstrated this
on one of the floors of the computer science building. The video below demo's this feature.</p>
